YAVPA
Yet Another Volition Package Archiver

What is a Volition Package?
A VP file is a file format used to combine a whole directory structure into a
single file. The most common use of an archiver for such a format is probably
modding the game FreeSpace 2.

How do I install?
While in the source directory, simply type 'make' to compile the binaries. If
you so desire, 'make install' will copy the binaries into /usr/bin/

How do I extract a VP file?
Simply use yavpu (yet another volition package unpacker). Usage is simple:
yavpu <extraction directory> <path to VP file>. So say you have BluePlanet
in your home folder and you wanted to extract bp-core.vp into your home
folder, and you have the binaries installed to /usr/bin. Simply type:
"yavpu ~/ ~/blueplanet/bp-core.vp" into the command line and a "data"
directory will appear in your home folder with all the bp-core files.

How do I make a VP file?
Simply use yavpp (yet another volition package packer). Usage for yavpp
is also simple: yavpp <path of new VP file> <path to file tree to pack>. So
if you wanted to make a VP called "mymod.vp" and you had a directory with the
path "~/mysuperdupermod/" that had all the files and folders to be included in
it, you would simply type "yavpp mymod.vp ~/mysuperdupermod/".

Why use YAVPA
YAVPA is a simple, command line Volition Package archive utility. The only
dependency is the standard C library, and it uses functions that are unlikely
to change. This means you don't have to install the latest and greatest GUI
library, nor do you have to worry about version X of the latest and greatest
GUI library breaking backwards compatibility with version Y. Additionally, the
YAVPA tools are designed "UNIX style," which means brevity. Neither of them
print anything to the console unless there is an error, which makes them
perfect for scripting.

Hacking:
If you wish to "hack" features into YAVPA, feel free to do so; the license is
MIT, so do literally whatever you want with it. If you have any questions about
the file format, check out README.VP. If you have other questions or think your
code should be added to the main branch, feel free to contact me.
